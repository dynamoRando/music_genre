# Overview

Request for reviewing the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre) for music.

Specifically, the request was -

> Show us a visual representation that explores danceability, popularity, and song key. Potential questions that could be asked are: What song key has the most danceability? How does popularity and song key relate? Are the most popular songs also the most danceable?


# Presentation
This dataset was reviewed using Python in a Juypter notebook. All graphs/charts are generated via the libraries mentioned below.

# Requirements

This Juypter notebook leverages Python3. You will need python installed on your computer along with the following libraries - 

- matplotlib
- pandas
- sqlite3
- numpy
- seaborn

To install any of these libaries after installing Python, you may run 

    pip install <library>

For example, to install matplotlib, you may run

    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install -U matplotlib

# Remarks

This was the author's first time leveraging some of these libraries. Much of the Python appoach upon review can be simplifed, and the visualizations further extended. That said, it was an enjoyable experience to try something new.
